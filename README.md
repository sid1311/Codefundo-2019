Elections in India have been always a controversial issue, and problems faced by people are booth capturing, EVM tampering etc.
Solution we propose is to solve some of these problems, we propose a new voting system thourgh which people will be able to vote through their mobile phones and each votes will be securly stored as transaction in the blockchain. This will ensure that secure vote counting and Voters who are not currently in their constituency will also be able to cast their votes, NRIs will also be able to vote with this system, To make it more secure face or biometrics verification will be done.
